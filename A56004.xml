         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Hope none will take Offence at what I have here inserted in the several <hi>Causes of Wrath,</hi> who do but Seriously and Impartially Read them out to an <hi>Amen,</hi> and then Weigh the whole in a Just Ballance. I know there are many Things, that may chance to Grate upon the Passions and Humours of not a few; and make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to Carp, yea, some will be ready to to Gnash their Teeth before the Time; but none of those Things move me: Though indeed I must confess, when I first entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this forced Undertaking, and laying my Account to meet with such Treatment, the first Thoughts of this, did a little Startle me, and I was often Tempted to Dash out several Sentences by that same Hand which wrote them, least I should Offend: But then another Thought of greater Weight, forced it's Way into my <hi>Conscience,</hi> and Shuffled out the former; when I considered, I am now <hi>Sisting</hi> my self in the Presence of <hi>GOD,</hi> that <hi>great Him, who seeth me,</hi> Imploring his Special <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,</hi> and Begging, that in every Step of this Work of greatest Moment, <hi>He</hi> would Guide my Spirit, and Direct my Pen: Then, I could not, nay for my Soul I durst not, <hi>omit</hi> any Thing that I Judged to be <hi>Duty</hi> on the one Hand, or <hi>Sin</hi> on the other. And whereas it is the ordinary Caution of every petty Judge unto a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for to say, Remember Sir, <hi>You are upon Oath,</hi> even so, Divine Providence Singling Unworthy Me out to <hi>Witness</hi> for the <hi>Truth,</hi> and having Solemnly Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged my self of <hi>all Malice, Pick</hi> or <hi>Prejudice</hi> against any Mans <hi>Person,</hi> I'm resolved <hi>to tell the Truth, and nothing but the Truth,</hi> and to conceal nothing of the <hi>Truth,</hi> according to my Personal Knowledge, and Credible Information, as the <hi>GOD</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> shall enable me. If thou ask, why doth this Fellow speak him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self frequently in the Plural Number? I Answer, have a care what thou sayest; every <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Earl</hi> Stiles himself, <hi>We;</hi> then why may not I do so too, who have the whole Body of the Nation upon my Side, to Espouse my Quarrel, whereof some at least, wisheth me well, and says, <hi>Be thou Warmed, be thou Cloathed,</hi> &amp;c. Others they Pray for me; nay some (if you please) will Fight for me: Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain hath much <hi>Zeal,</hi> and little <hi>Wit,</hi> warm Hearts, and hot Heads, but empty
<pb facs="tcp:35147:3"/> Noddles, yet good Bodies too, and ought rather to be Informed thou sighted: Thousands likewise, who have true <hi>Zeal,</hi> rightly tempered with Commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Prudence,</hi> who dare not shift a <hi>Necessar and Seasonable</hi> Duty, when it comes in their Road, but still keeping within their own proper Sphere, and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently longing to hear or see their betters Act to better purpose in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Stations. Therefore, by this time they are become like so many <hi>Elihu's,</hi> their Belly is as Wine, which hath no vent, it is ready to burst like New Bottles; It is in the Power of <hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> to peirce the Bottle without breaking it, and give us ease; Let them then give in their Reasons at the <hi>Greet Day,</hi> why they do it not.

For these Raw and faint well-wishers, I know not what they serve for, or what to do with them; however, since they will needs faun upon me, merely for Cake and Pudding, I must pitty them till they gather Spirits. In short, put it to a fair Pole, give us but a free Vote, we carry the day, and ought therefore to have our Just demands satisfied.

Alas! We have all reason, both <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>People</hi> (when we compare our selves with our <hi>Fore-fathers</hi>) to cry out as in <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.7, 8.

And O our <hi>DEAREST PRINCE,</hi> do but see, how wonderfully GOD did Bless and succeed this Godly Monarch, in so good and Necessar a Work, by Remarkably and suddenly changing the Hearts of his Subjects, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding after so long and general <hi>Defection</hi> and <hi>Apostacy, v.</hi> 36.

Then (to incourage all Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Kings and Princes to do the same upon the like occasion, and to do it Honestly) the Sacred History concludeth with this: That whatever <hi>Hesekiah</hi> did of this Nature. he did it <hi>with all his Heart,</hi> and therefore pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered: Nowise like either our Masked <hi>Jeraboam</hi> or barefac'd <hi>Reboboam</hi> in the late unhappy Reigns, who whatever they did of this kind, was quite cross to their true temper and Inclination, with a secret Heart Aversion: Or otherwise, from a Spirit of <hi>deep dissimulation</hi> and <hi>Carnal policy.</hi> And so came of it, GOD early forsaking them both; Witness, the one turning a

This is, I am sure, the Earnest and hearty Prayers of all good Men, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties best Subjects. But to return. I say, this in nowise is to be Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our GRACIOUS PRINCE (in a manner a Stranger unto us) For how can we Imagine, that HE should know and be acquainted with our <hi>Humours</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> at such a distance, as we ourselves are, to our Smarting <hi>Experience:</hi> But these fauning sycophantick, underminding and Bribing Moles, or to speak in broad <hi>Scots,</hi> these Moudiwarts, these Earth-worms, these Horse-Leeches, these self-Gormondizers, these <hi>Heart Enemies</hi> to all <hi>good Government, Civil</hi> or <hi>Sacred,</hi> will needs insinuat themselves upon, and croud in to Places of publick Trust by Money, Interest or Court-Factions, the constant Plague and Bane of Government.

THOU HAST LEFT THY FIRST LOVE; and this is certainly the Root and Rise of all our other defections and steppings aside in <hi>Practice</hi> or <hi>Principles,</hi> from the <hi>good old Paths,</hi> wherein we walked, when <hi>Grace</hi> was in its <hi>Lively ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant</hi> within the <hi>Heart.</hi> This is the great and main duty, and First Work the Lord has been by many <hi>loud crys,</hi> calling us to, these years past, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. <hi>That we should Remember from whence we are fallen, Repent and do our FIRST WORKS,</hi> With that dreadful Certification, <hi>That our Candlestick shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, except we Repent:</hi> And indeed, if we do not look about us in time, we have Reason to <hi>expect</hi> and <hi>dread it;</hi> For though God hath said, <hi>The Gates of Hell shall not prevail against his Church,</hi> yet there is not <hi>one Promise</hi> in the whole Bible, securing any particular Church. The lamentable Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the said instance of these once Famous Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> &amp;c. Confirm this. This great and growing decay may be sadly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed from the manifest Fruits thereof: As 1. Our Great and woeful <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness</hi> and <hi>Fruitlesness</hi> in the Practice of Godliness, under a Preached Gospel, notwithstanding <hi>purely dispensed</hi> by the poor wrestling <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Ambassadors</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> Toiling all the Day, and catching little or nothing; so that we seem to be very near the Execution of that dreadful Sentence, CUT THEM DOWN, CUT THEM DOWN, WHY CUMBER THEY THE GROUND?

                  <p>But 2ly, <hi>Our great and woeful Decay,</hi> Appeareth in our resting in an unseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and <hi>superficial</hi> Form and performance of <hi>Religious Duties,</hi> such as <hi>Reading</hi> or <hi>Hearing</hi> of the <hi>Word, Secret</hi> and <hi>Family Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. little Studying the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> or stirring up our selves to take hold of God, &amp; to attain to that practical Mysterie of <hi>Communion and Fellowship with
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35147:26"/> God</hi> in these Holy exercises, which is the Chief end and use thereof. Yea, not a few of our <hi>Scots Apostats,</hi> who some time ago, from a <hi>Natural Conscience,</hi> made a fashion of <hi>Worshiping God</hi> in their <hi>Families,</hi> hath now given that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessar and Commendable Duty quite over, others to stop the Mouth of that same Natural Conscience, doth think themselves sufficiently Exoner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before a Holy GOD (who bids us <hi>abound in the work of the Lord,</hi> and who hath said, <hi>Cursed is every one that doth this work negligently,</hi> and <hi>who hath a Male in his Flock, and offereth a Female (Corrupt thing)</hi> I say, they think it very fair, if they make some formal shew of Family Worship only upon Sabbath days in the evening, some Reading a Chapter, and no more; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Reading and Singing, but no bowing of a Knee to their Maker; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again <hi>avowedly graceless,</hi> openly ridiculing, contemning and disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of this Nature, never regarding that fearful Word <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy Fury upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that call not on thy Name,</hi> where you see, the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> ranketh these <hi>VVretches</hi> among <hi>wild Heathens.</hi> 3. Want of delight, and rather wearying in all these Religious performances, especially those which are most Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, as <hi>secret Prayer, Holy Meditation, Self searching, watching over the Heart and Conversation,</hi> which sometime hath been pleasant, when our Fathers, yea, many of our selves, <hi>sat under his Shadow with great delight, and his Fruit was Sweet to our tast;</hi> the want whereof doth now discover a sad decay of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> in the <hi>inner Man.</hi> 4. The great Unclearness and Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a PERSONAL INTEREST IN CHRIST and the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> which many now Labours under, and the little Care there is to have this <hi>Interest</hi> made sure, and as little <hi>Exercise</hi> for the <hi>want</hi> thereof; and though this may be generally Complained of, yet alas! the remedy is little indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, but a deep <hi>security,</hi> until the awakning come, (may be) on a <hi>Death-bed,</hi> with a Flood of <hi>Amazements,</hi> with dread and horrour of <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The prevailing and growing Power of our Corruptions within, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly follows upon <hi>decay of Grace,</hi> yea such prevailing Power, that many gets not <hi>Restrained</hi> from breaking forth in <hi>Offensive practices,</hi> and others have enough a do to get them keeped within Doors. 6. The great <hi>Indulging</hi> and <hi>Fostering</hi> of folks own <hi>predominat evils,</hi> such as <hi>Pride, Passion,</hi> and <hi>Sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The little <hi>Regard</hi> that is had to the giving and occasioning of <hi>Offence,</hi> and the great aptitude and readiness there is, to take Offence, or st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35147:26"/>
                     <hi>Faintings</hi> (many times, we know not our selves for what, <hi>Unbelief</hi> and <hi>distrust,</hi> creating Bugg-Bears in our way) that not a few labours under, both <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>People;</hi> And this fear frequently breaking forth in our Sinful and Scandalous <hi>shifting</hi> and <hi>shunning</hi> of many of the <hi>necessar</hi> and <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Duties</hi> we have been urgently called to perform; yea almost every <hi>Duty,</hi> which is attended with any probable or seeming <hi>Danger,</hi> &amp; <hi>difficulty,</hi> have been utterly shifted by (alas!) too many upon that account; particularly that great concerning Point of <hi>Presbyterian Government;</hi> in Joyntly and Zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously standing up for the Royal Prerogative of our great Lord and Master Jesus Christ, as <hi>Supreme Lord and only King and Head of His Church,</hi> together with the true Liberties, Priviledges, and <hi>Intrinsick Power</hi> of the Church. As <hi>Luther</hi> said of Justification, that true <hi>Religion</hi> either <hi>Stands</hi> or <hi>Falls,</hi> as we are <hi>Sound</hi> or <hi>Unsound</hi> in this Cardinal Article of our Faith. So I may say, that <hi>Presbyterian Government</hi> Stands or Falls, as they either <hi>strenuously Contend for,</hi> or <hi>faintingly Yeelds</hi> and lets go the <hi>least Hoove</hi> or punctilio of this Cardinal Point. 9. The <hi>great neglect</hi> of that necessar and profitable Duty of privat <hi>Christian-Fellowship for Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Godly Conferrence for mutual Edification:</hi> And tho it be true, that severals in many places, makes yet Conscience to keep up the Exercise of this Duty, and that sometimes, I hope, to <hi>blest Advantage,</hi> and for keeping themselves in a <hi>Lively Frame;</hi> Though alas! far inferior to what it has been formerly: Yet, how many are there in <hi>Scotland,</hi> both in <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> who are Persons capable to Associat themselves into Societys for that Effect, and have no <hi>Reasonable Lett</hi> in their way to hinder, who notwithstanding do <hi>Indulge</hi> themselves in the utter neglect thereof; Some looking on it, as the Duty only of Little Ones, or the weaker sort of Christians, but below them, who think themselves come to Maturity; Some pretending the <hi>Abuse</hi> of that Exercise, an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> that may plead against any other Duty of Religion, as well as this; Others pretending frivolous <hi>Excuses,</hi> and needless <hi>Niceties:</hi> So that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Matter of no small Difficulty, either to get such to joyn in these Societies, or keeped from wearying and breaking off, if at any time they be ingaged therein. Yea, there is too good Ground to complain of <hi>some Ministers</hi> their Deficiency to <hi>stirr up and incourage</hi> to this Duty, or to engage themselves therein, which might be both profitable to themselves, and these Societies too, for better <hi>Regulating</hi> them to <hi>Edification.</hi> It was the Lawdable Practice of our <hi>Ministers</hi> in our <hi>Best Days,</hi> before our <hi>Declinings,</hi> both to <hi>press</hi> this Duty frequently <hi>in Publick,</hi> and also by their own <hi>Good Example</hi> to commend it to others: Though this <hi>Blessed Exercise</hi> was never more urgently <hi>called for</hi> than at this Day, when the Hand of a <hi>Provoked, Jealous,</hi> and <hi>Angry GOD,</hi> is pressing us very sore every way: O to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Number of those MARKED ONES, who <hi>Sigh</hi> and <hi>Cry</hi> for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35147:27"/> their own <hi>Sins,</hi> and the <hi>Abominations</hi> of the <hi>Sinful Place</hi> and <hi>Land</hi> they-live in, and <hi>who fear the LORD and speak often one to another,</hi> such have a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Interest and Claime to GODs <hi>Distinguishing Favour</hi> and <hi>Special Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> even <hi>Temporal Preservation</hi> in publick and National Calamities, when others are neither spared nor pittyed by the <hi>Destroying Angel,</hi> making no distinction betwixt the avowed openly debauch'd <hi>Malignant,</hi> and the Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hearted, lukewarm, formal blazing Professor, nor betwixt the formal Professor, and the Timerous, Cowardly, Faint-hearted, Ceding Kirk-man; do but seriously read the 9. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Mal:</hi> 3.16, 17, 18.10. The dislike and prejudice many have taken and still take at free Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Warning, <hi>Reproving Preaching and Preachers,</hi> who do and must make Conscience <hi>to cry aloud, and lift up their Voice like a Trumpet, to show them and the Land their Sins and Transgressions,</hi> yea sometimes a <hi>Minister</hi> is counted and <hi>Offender</hi> for a <hi>Reproving Word,</hi> by not a few <hi>Professing Friends,</hi> choosing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hear Ministers preach smooth and <hi>Fair Generals,</hi> and prophesying of <hi>Peace,</hi> but cannot endure the sound Doctrine of <hi>Reproof,</hi> and discovering the <hi>Crying Sins</hi> of the time; and as many love to have it thus, so they have it alas! too frequently. 11. The great and almost utter neglect of that clearly commanded Duty, to <hi>Reprove</hi> and <hi>Admonish</hi> one another; And the great Difficulty there is to get our selves brought into that <hi>Mortified</hi> and <hi>Composed Frame,</hi> suteable either to <hi>Give</hi> or <hi>Take</hi> Reproof to Edification; But <hi>Passions</hi> rising often on either Hand, to marr all. It may now be sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, <hi>Let no Man strive nor reprove another,</hi> &amp;c. How rare a thing is it to find either <hi>privat Professors,</hi> and not a few <hi>Ministers,</hi> in case to be <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished</hi> by one another (even for things <hi>Justly reproveable</hi>) or when <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished,</hi> to <hi>Amend;</hi> But rather a propensity to <hi>defend</hi> and argue in Defence of the things they are Admonished for? 12. The great <hi>Security and senselessness,</hi> which hath seized on us in all this evil and decayed Frame, under which we ly and <hi>pine away,</hi> using little or no <hi>Effectual Means,</hi> to stirr up our selves into the Exercise of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Recovering</hi> from our sad Condition, so as to recover our wonted <hi>Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Tenderness,</hi> which was formerly found in this Church.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The Lamentable <hi>grieving</hi> and <hi>vexing</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of GOD</hi> by many, the <hi>Resisting</hi> and <hi>Quenching</hi> it by others; And a third black set of Wretches, who in stead of working out their <hi>Salvation</hi> with fear and trembling, they merrily and unregarded work out their own <hi>Damnation,</hi> and goes dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the Pit, by openly doing <hi>despite to the Spirit of Grace,</hi> and <hi>mocking</hi> at all <hi>Serious Religion,</hi> the fearful mark of that <hi>unpardonable Sin against the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. Our little <hi>Concernedness</hi> and small <hi>Sympathy</hi> we have with the <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Temptations</hi> of our <hi>Brethren,</hi> the poor persecuted <hi>Protestants</hi> abroad, the miserable and sinking State of that once famous and flourishing <hi>Church</hi>

And which is a sore Matter, we have not to this Day Made it our business, effectually to fix and settle a mutual Correspondence betwixt us and these afflicted People, <hi>Tossed with Tempest and not Comforted,</hi> and other <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> abroad (as our <hi>Zealous Predecessors</hi> thought it their bound Duty to do) so that we are as <hi>Ignorant</hi> of their particular <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi> either as to their outward <hi>Condition,</hi> or inward <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as if they were living beyond the wild Deserts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> by which we are mightily straitned in our Prayers, knowing neither how, nor what to Pray for them.

(I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire all along to Caution my Words, I speak not this of them all, I know there are some more Sober and Sound than others) But likewayes a Pack of <hi>prophane scandalous Wretches, Drunkards, Swearers,</hi> and <hi>Obscene Vagabond Fellows,</hi> polutting both City and Countrey with their IRREGULAR BAPTISMS, MARRIAGES, &amp;c. Who do not in the least scruple (for a small piece of Money) to <hi>Baptize</hi> all the <hi>Bastards</hi> and <hi>Illegittimat-Brats</hi> in the Kingdom, without enquiring after either Father or Mother; Nor to joyn in <hi>Marriage</hi> the <hi>Brother</hi> with his <hi>Sister</hi> (for any thing they know, their Enquiry, if any at all, being very overly, only for a <hi>Sham-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneration</hi>) And to marry a Man unto one Woman <hi>to Day,</hi> and to another <hi>to Morrow,</hi> and both alive, the which they have already done. Now, if these of the more Sober and Sound amongst them, had but the above <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessar Qualifications</hi> and <hi>Marks,</hi> then I should be for <hi>Moderation,</hi> yea for the hight of <hi>Moderation</hi> in their favours, as much as any Man: But this is <hi>too good a WORD</hi> to make a <hi>Baffle,</hi> a <hi>Nose of Wax,</hi> a <hi>Mock</hi> of: Let us not make it a common <hi>Gallio-Bridge</hi> for both <hi>Clean</hi> and <hi>Unclean</hi> to pass over; Let us not <hi>stretch</hi> it further, or <hi>skrue</hi> it higher, than the <hi>Blessed Unerring Rule</hi> will suffer it to go.</p>
                  <p>A second is, The dayly Oathing and Swearing the Leidges upon every small Triffle (I will not say, relating to the publick Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Monethly,</hi> and hold up their Hands and Swear again and again by the Great GOD for the Value, if it were but a <hi>Six-pence,</hi> yea, even for the least <hi>Gill of Brandy, &amp;c.</hi> Retailed by them; So that Multitudes of <hi>Ignorant Creatures</hi> who have a small Livelyhood, little or no Gain thereby, and perhaps as little Knowledge and Conscience, are (besides their taking the <hi>Holy Name of</hi> GOD <hi>in vain</hi>) undoubtedly and unavoidably PERJURED; Otherwayes, utterly undone if they scruple to Swear. O Lamentable! Ah National Grievance! (as if the poor Land were not deeply enough already sunk in PERJURY) That Men of whatsoever Perswasion, <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, Episcopal,</hi> every <hi>Jacobit-Malignant, Atheist-fellow,</hi> should be <hi>Toller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,</hi> nay perhaps <hi>Impowered</hi> thus to do what they list: We have been so inur'd and habituat in Debauching our own and other Men's Consciences, in the late Heathenish Reigns, that we cannot get off it to this very Day. Ah! to what a pittyful pass and puzling Streach are we come, that we cannot get ten Faithful, Creditable Monyed Men in all <hi>Scotland</hi> of undoubted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, whom King and Countrey may Trust, to collect the publick Fonds (I confess such a Sett was never rarer since <hi>Scotland</hi> became Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) but must be necessitat to flee for Relief to the next dangerous Horn of the <hi>Dilemma,</hi> to put all to a <hi>Common Roup,</hi> and entrust our <hi>Princes Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues</hi> and the <hi>Kingdoms Substance,</hi> to every <hi>Tantivi-Tory; Malignant Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner,</hi> who bids most (whatever <hi>Oaths</hi> they may come under to gain their Point) and then not only puting the whole Superplus and Excrescence into their own privat Pockets; But likeways, the <hi>Fatal Event,</hi> and our constant <hi>Sad Experience</hi> makes it too probable, that (like so many voraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and greedy gripping Hounds) they run with violent Hands, and a Conscience wide like Hell upon the very <hi>Stock</hi> it self, which is <hi>Sacred,</hi> and set a part by express Act of Parliament, for His <hi>Majestie's Use,</hi> and the <hi>Publick Concerns</hi> of the Kingdom. And moreover, such may be their Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Idolatry (<hi>Covetousness</hi> I mean) that notwithstanding they come off considerable <hi>Gainers,</hi> yet perhaps may have the <hi>Impudence</hi> to Bill his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Honourable <hi>Council,</hi> and Petition for an Abatement, pretending they have mett with great Losses by Disappointments, Accidents, vast Charges, necessar Contingencies, National Calamities, and what not? when, ten to one, that same Summ they seem to come short of, is already lying secure in their Coffers. And if they (by Ways and Means) should come to get a hearing, and their Petition granted, which is hardly suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, this were a way indeed to blind our Eyes, &amp; render them altogether Innocent. Surely one of these three must hold, either there must be great <hi>Villains</hi> and <hi>Villanies</hi> amongst us, or we must be a pack of <hi>wicked and sloothful servants▪</hi> or otherwayes <hi>all Men are Liars.</hi> But these things are True or not; If not (which I will not deny, for you hear me <hi>affirm nothing positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>) Then these Men are mightily wrong'd by <hi>Common Fame</hi> and <hi>Universal

GOD doth Blow upon all, and how can it otherwayes be; So long as the most part of us, are so madly pursuing <hi>Cursed Self,</hi> and we, <hi>Base Spirits, Narrow Souls, Large Consciences, Greedy Hearts,</hi> and <hi>Gripping Hands?</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the <hi>Ingenuous Reader</hi> still to take this alongst with him, for the <hi>Author's Vindication,</hi> that he does not speak his own <hi>Positive Sentiments,</hi> but only declareth what he heareth as the constant increasing <hi>Noise and Complaint,</hi> and what is the Universal <hi>Report</hi> and <hi>Clamour</hi> of almost every <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman,</hi> in <hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>Mercat, Street</hi> and <hi>Tavern, City</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> which must needs <hi>Tempt him</hi> to say with <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18. <hi>I hear there be such and such things among you, and I partly believe it.</hi> You may <hi>Observe</hi> likewayes all alongs, that I have some other <hi>Weighty Design</hi> in mine Eye, than in seeming, to <hi>Reflect</hi> upon any particular Person, which <hi>Presseth</hi> me to be thus plain, <hi>viz:</hi> To <hi>Prevent,</hi> if possible, others from running themselves head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the like <hi>fearful Guilt.</hi> For Instance, when I speak (as above) of poor <hi>silly VVomen,</hi> and other <hi>Ignorant Bodies,</hi> who have <hi>little VVit,</hi> and probably as little <hi>Conscience;</hi> My chief Design is to <hi>Frighten</hi> and <hi>Deterr</hi> them and all Others in time coming, from darring to involve themselves in the <hi>Dreadful Guilt</hi> and <hi>Crying Sin of Perjury,</hi> &amp;c. which is certainly one of the great and <hi>Provoking Causes</hi> of GODs <hi>Wrath,</hi> and which doth make the whole Land [as at this day] for to <hi>Mourn</hi> and <hi>Groan</hi> under the <hi>Fatal</hi> and <hi>Direful Effects</hi> thereof; Surely no serious Soul, nay good Christian, durst

I hope therefore, the <hi>Reader</hi> will pardon me, if I reach a <hi>By-blow,</hi> and throw a <hi>Squibb</hi> now and then at some <hi>particular Anonimo's,</hi> not in the least to hurt them, but to <hi>Allarm</hi> and <hi>Reclaim</hi> such, if <hi>Guilty;</hi> And [if they plead <hi>Not Guilty</hi>] to <hi>Forewarn</hi> and <hi>Caution</hi> them and all others, from swallowing such <hi>Dangerous Baits</hi> for the future.</p>
                  <p>A Third is anent our <hi>Fast days, Preparation—, Communion,</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-days,</hi> the dangerous effects whereof upon the whole Land, and upon many a <hi>Poor Soul</hi> may make us Tremble for to think on't.

It had been far better for multitudes of Men and Women, that <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> and our <hi>Good Government</hi> of Church and State had never appointed and set a part such <hi>Blessed Seasons</hi> of GRACE and MERCY, they being all so strangely and fearfully <hi>perverted and abused</hi> by them, as <hi>Pearls</hi> thrown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so many Swine.

But alas! Upon the Contrar, how many <hi>(Avowedly profane</hi> and <hi>impious)</hi> has no regard at all to this Precious and <hi>Critical Season:</hi> O what can we expect, will be the Portion of such, when the Man or Woman that comes even the length of <hi>Counterfeit Humility,</hi> and sorrow on such a day, do meet with so severe a <hi>Check</hi> and sharp <hi>Rebuke</hi> from the SPIRIT of the LORD <hi>Isai,</hi> 58.5. <hi>Zech.</hi> 7, 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> especially when <hi>Reformation</hi> doth not follow upon it <hi>Isai.</hi> 1. from <hi>ver.</hi> 11, to 21. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.16.17. It being as hateful to a HOLY GOD, as the <hi>Killing of a Man, offering up of Swins Blood, or the Cutting off of a Dogs Neck, Isai.</hi> 66.3, 4. Who upon a <hi>Fast or Preparation</hi> day before the Communion are passing through the dark and dry Valley of <hi>Baca</hi> (of <hi>Black Nature</hi>) upon the consciencious Search and Tryal of their State and of their way, Plowing up the fellow Ground of their Hearts, there digging deep with <hi>Sensible</hi> and <hi>Humble Convictions,</hi> till they make a Well of Tears and Godly Sorrow, so
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:35147:31"/> that the Heavenly Rain of the <hi>Spirits influence</hi> may fall down and fill the Pools of their <hi>Affections,</hi> with the Waters of Joy and Consolation; then afterward (by a <hi>tender strict and Holy Walk</hi>) making it their Work to go on from Strength to Strength, from one Degree of Grace to another, till it be perfected in Glory. Some indeed do make a fashion of seeking God before they go to tread his Courts, but suffice themselves with an <hi>Overly, Formal confused, short, Lifeless Word,</hi> upon their <hi>Sin,</hi> upon their Danger, upon their State and Case (great Concerning Points) upon which Holy Men of GOD has thought it worth their while to write whole <hi>Volumns.</hi> O who are groaning out their Case in secret before the Lord?

I <hi>will wash mine hands in Innocency, So will I compass thine Altar O LORD?</hi> Ah! Who are considering the place they are going to, is no less than <hi>Holy Ground,</hi> and therefore by a Fixed and Holy Resolution puting off their Shoes from of the Feet of their vain, wicked and filthy Conversation? Then might they <hi>Exult</hi> with the Psalmist Ps. 43.4. <hi>Then will I go unto the Altar of GOD, unto GOD my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Joy.</hi> O what if not a few, <hi>cry Hosanna</hi> to him upon a <hi>Communion Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> and before next Saturday, cry <hi>Crucifie him,</hi> by their <hi>Untender VValk,</hi> their <hi>Unwatchfulness,</hi> by their <hi>Corrupt Communication, rash Swearing, Tippling, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, vain and profane Company,</hi> &amp;c. What think you of them, that knows no more what it means to lay hold on Christ, to receive Christ, to put on Christ, <hi>to make use of Christ,</hi> to <hi>make a Personal Covenant with Christ,</hi> or any thing of that nature, than the very Reprobat World doth, and yet bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rusheth <hi>Blindfold</hi> unto that <hi>Sacred Table,</hi> designed not for <hi>Converting</hi> to Christ, but Confirming, Establishing and Sealing a <hi>Believer in Christ, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Converted?</hi> O how many, from Soul satisfaction, and upon Solid grounds, can say with the <hi>Spouse, Cant.</hi> 4.16. <hi>let my Beloved come unto his Garden and eat His pleasant Fruits,</hi> who have not yet made Choice of their Beloved, cordially and fully closed with Christ, are not past the pangs of the new Birth, and therefore has no Garden to invite him to, but the Garden of the <hi>Sluggard,</hi> black Nature, all over growen with the stinking Weeeds of <hi>Corruption,</hi> hearts full of, not only Raging but reigning Sins, a very Sink of unmortified Lusts. And what <hi>Fruit</hi> can they present their pretended Beloved from this <hi>Cursed Root
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:35147:31"/> and Tree,</hi> but Grapes of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and Aples of <hi>Gomorah?</hi> Not one Grain of <hi>Saving Grace</hi> in that Poor Soul. What think you of the <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Woman,</hi> who [notwithstanding of all this] are at no <hi>Consciencious Pains,</hi> taketh no <hi>Sufficient Time</hi> to take a look of their <hi>State,</hi> turn over their <hi>Evidences,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their <hi>Hearts,</hi> and get a suitable <hi>Frame of Soul</hi> before they venture upon that <hi>Tremenduous Ordinance;</hi> And are at as little pains after a <hi>Communion,</hi> to Search, Try, Examine, and ask GOD and their own Hearts, what they have <hi>Got,</hi> and what they have <hi>Missed;</hi> Whether thereby they have hight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their <hi>Condemnation,</hi> or got their <hi>Bands Loosed?</hi> If they have been feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>empty Husks,</hi> or has got CHRIST in them the <hi>Hope of Glory,</hi> &amp;c. And so comes of it, for I appeal to their own Consciences, if there be the smallest Signs of any Saving Change wrought in them, or the least Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation upon the back of it. Ah! If the Great GOD (at any of these Solemn Appearances) should come down to the Congregation, and ask the Question with an Audible Voice, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 30.21. <hi>Who is this that hath engaged his Heart to approach unto Me?</hi> Who amongst these durst or could hold up their Faces, &amp; give a Conscience Satisfying Answer to Him? Alas! I am afraid, our naughty unprepared Hearts (for the most part of us) would quickly like <hi>Nabels</hi> sink and die within us, and become as a Stone, and we fall down before Him, like so many Bold and Darring Guilty Criminals. And what if CHRIST, the Great MASTER of the FEAST, the INVIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER, and the FEAST it self (who is alwayes present in a way of MERCY to some, and JUSTICE to others, both entertaining and viewing His Guests) should stand at the Head of His own Table, looking narrowly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Him, with His All-pearcing Eye (as indeed He doth, when we little consider it) not only to the outward Appearance and Behaviour, but chiefly and principally to the Heart, to the deepest and most secret Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners there, to the <hi>Inner-Man,</hi> both as to the Gracious State &amp; Frame of the Soul; And should single out every <hi>Uunconverted and unworthy Communicant,</hi> and by Name and Sir-Name, Call to the hearing of all about them, FRIEND <hi>(Pretended Professor, Dead Moralist, Bold Hypocrite, Presumptuous Wretch, Prophane Fellow)</hi> HOW CAMEST THOU IN HITHER, NOT HAVING THE WEDDING GARMENT? O what unprepared Soul (the up-sitten Believer not excepted) were able to stand before this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming and Soul killing Question? But then, what think you of those who are come to the length of Men and Women, nay to Midle and Old Age, who have never to this day gone to the <hi>Table of the LORD,</hi> and all because of the <hi>Necessity</hi> of the above requisit and necessar <hi>Qualifications:</hi> Let me tell such, as it is a <hi>Fearful Sin</hi> to go <hi>Unprepared,</hi> so I reckon it a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, Unexcusable, and Unaccountable <hi>Sin</hi> on the other Hand, not to <hi>Fit</hi> and <hi>Prepare</hi> themselves for it, making still the other sinful and God-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking Excuse (let it be what it will) which will never abide the <hi>Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:35147:32"/> Tryal</hi> of either GOD or their own Conscienes, at a <hi>Tribunal</hi> or on a <hi>Death-bed.</hi> As for <hi>Secret Despisers</hi> and <hi>avowed Contemners</hi> of such Gracious Opportunities, <hi>open Ridiculers</hi> and <hi>Mockers,</hi> who with their own Hands, do throw the very <hi>Door of Mercy</hi> on their own Teeth, that in stead of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Divine Worship</hi> on Week-Dayes, Sabbath-Dayes, and upon such <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Occasions,</hi> do either Loyter in their Beds, or goeth in Cabals, spends and wastes these <hi>Invaluable Minuts</hi> in one anothers Chambers, in Taverns, Ale-houses, nay probably with their <hi>Loathsome Whores,</hi> and about some <hi>gross Villanies,</hi> not to be named, <hi>Blaspheming GOD, Damning themselves, Cursing one another, and Railing and Raging against the Faithful Servants of CHRIST, and the whole Government be the By;</hi> A fearful mispending and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the <hi>Blessed Dayes</hi> of their <hi>Visitation,</hi> and a sad Return they give to that <hi>Great Question</hi> (which every Child knoweth) WHAT IS THE CHIEF END OF MAN? As for such, I am wholly at a Stance, what to say either to them or for them; It passeth the Skill of a <hi>Solomon</hi> to give his <hi>Advice</hi> here, they being upon the very brink of the unpardonable Sin against the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> if not already <hi>Plung'd</hi> into it; So that I am afraid that same <hi>Blessed Spirit</hi> has past the Word, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.17. LET THEM A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LONE; these sporting <hi>Leviathans,</hi> Job. 41. <hi>Whose skales are their pride, shut up together as with a closs Seal; Out of whose mouths goeth burning Lamps, and sparks of Fire flee out; Whose Hearts are as firm as a Stone, yea as hard as a piece of the nether Mill-stone, Who laugh at the shaking of the Spear,</hi> &amp;c. So that it seemeth to no purpose to throw <hi>Pearls</hi> before such <hi>Swine,</hi> or cast <hi>Holy Things</hi> unto <hi>Dogs,</hi> in whom there is nothing wanting to begin their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but Soul Distress, Anguish of Spirit, Horrour of Conscience, the Terrors of GOD to Distract them, all which, may come upon them in one Night: Therefore, I here leave them with the poor possessed Man, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Cutting and slashing himself amongst the Tombs;</hi> these Lunatick Desperatly mad Wretches, possessed with such a furious Devil, whom nothing can Tame, Bind, or Engage, whom none of our LORDs Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples can cast out and cure, except CHRIST Himself step in and speak the Word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.17. BRING HIM HITHER TO ME; for sure they are resolved (as long as they can) never to come in his way: If He come in theirs, it is well, if not, they are <hi>lost for ever:</hi> But this seemeth to be too mild and gentle a Comparison; For that Devil in <hi>Mark</hi> 5.

I rather leave these filthy <hi>Gadarean Swine</hi> (in whom an unclean and raging Devil has so visibly and sensibly entered) to run on, till they throw themselves headlong over that steepr Pecipies, the <hi>dreadful Rock of their own presumption,</hi> into the Immense Oeean of <hi>Eternal Vengeance.</hi> I will not say what an <hi>Omnipotent</hi> Hand of Power by a Miracle of MERCY may do to Overtake and Recover One,

All which a Christian <hi>Scots-Man,</hi> who hath his Eyes but half open, cannot but attribut this in a great Measure to the above Causes of GODs Wrath and Displeasure against us. And doubtless he hath been all alongst, and still is saying to ever Man of us in particular, Great and Small, as well Ministers as People, as <hi>Joshua</hi> said to <hi>Achan; My Son, give I pray thee Glory to the LORD GOD of</hi> Israel, <hi>and make Confession unto him, and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.</hi> Is there not an <hi>absolute necessity,</hi> for our own <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> every way, to ridd our selves speedily of all these <hi>Achans,</hi> by openly <hi>Confessing</hi> them, and <hi>Condemning</hi> and <hi>Abjuring</hi> such <hi>Practices</hi> for ever, and do something to purpose, if possible to <hi>Appease</hi> an <hi>Angry GOD,</hi> least <hi>Wrath come upon us to the uttermost,</hi> and that same GOD break out upon us, and appear suddenly in our Camp against both <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Church</hi> and <hi>State?</hi> And what if the <hi>Slighting, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting, Delaying,</hi> &amp; <hi>putting off of some necessar &amp; seasonable Dutys,</hi> be the <hi>Grand Achan</hi> that leads the Van, or at least one of the first Rank? I think this <hi>Question</hi> may have its own weight, and of Greater Importance than we are aware of▪ The Lord is our Witness, we desire to seek nothing, but what we think your selves will acknowledgh to be, not only Duty, but Seasonable Duty and what we may safely paund our Lives (nay let us say our Souls) will undoubtedly Contribute to the <hi>Happyness</hi> of both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People, Church and State.</hi> And let me tell you, the <hi>Present pulse</hi> of the People of <hi>Scotland;</hi> they declare, that as a <hi>GRACIOUS GOD</hi> alloweth us to give him no rest, <hi>till he make</hi> JERUSALEM <hi>a praise in the Earth,</hi> so they are resolved to give,

Who in our day, regardeth that word, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.20. <hi>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy Might?</hi> No, but on the Contrar, our cowardly Language is, Let us have a care what we do; and then, how we do it, least we <hi>Offend and Displease</hi> some, and irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat others, or indanger our selves. I am far from Condemning Calm and Gentle Methods, necessar Caution and <hi>Commendable Prudence;</hi> and do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously acknowledge, (alas for the intangling Reasons of it) that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> was never so apparently necessar as now in our Critical Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, after so long a Tract of Defection and <hi>Corruption, Graceless Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and wicked Example;</hi> withall, considering the unaccountable <hi>perverseseness</hi> of Mens minds, the Natural averseness and rooted <hi>prejudice,</hi> that this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (by any that ever lived) hath at <hi>Strictness of Life, serious Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Power of Godliness,</hi> and therefore startled at any thing that looketh like further <hi>Reformation</hi> amongst them: For which I am afraid (the most part of them being so left of GOD) that it will be found scarce worth our while at the long run, to make all this Bussle and pains about, if it were not, that we may enjoy our <hi>Mercies and Priviledges</hi> in some Peace amongst them and to prevent, if possible, their further relapses, by being unhappy Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in again underminding, overturning and destroying what the great GOD hath given us, and the Laws of the Land hath Confirmed unto us, and which is happily secured in our Favours; as far as the Faith of our truely Reformed Protestant <hi>Prince</hi> can make it, by his express repeated Promises, fixed Resolution, chearful Concurrence, Assent and Consent: However, I think the Man (of what Quality soever) that is lost by <hi>Pick</hi> or <hi>Prejudice,</hi> is scarcely worth our finding again, especially at the Expence of wronging the Cause, by declining a more Necessar and Seasonable Duty; Particularly, the further Advances of a begun Work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and exercising strict and <hi>impartial Discipline without exception?</hi> else to what purpose are Laws and Acts made as to Civil punishments and Church Censures, if not with a Fixed design to put them to <hi>due execution;</hi> And yet with all the <hi>Gentleness, Tenderness</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> which the Nature of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and the Circumstances and Quality of the Persons will allow: Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, we being but Men at the best, we had need to advert, for its Ten to one, if we do not <hi>sinfully ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In Summ, I wish we may not have already exceeded the due bounds of Scripture Moderation: For, we seeking to extricat our selves out of difficulties by Carnal Policy, and such like Methods, do clearly see and feel to our sad experience, that the Lord hath justly turned it into our Plague and Judgment, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now make a handsom Retreat; so that we must say, as in <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9. <hi>He hath Hedged us about, that we cannot get out; He hath made our Chain hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy: And now when we cry, he shutteth out our Prayer.

               <p>There is one thing more, which deserves our serious Consideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That the many <hi>Corruptions</hi> and <hi>Defections,</hi> which has insensibly creep'd in by degrees, among the poor <hi>Reformed Protestants abroad,</hi> are (we doubt not) the Causes of their present sad Disasters, which has provock'd a JEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOUS GOD (who afflicts not willingly) to fling them into the Furnace: And they being as Beacons to us, to keep off from spleeting our selves on these Rock, let us then look about us, while (I hope) it is yet time, least we be thrown in next into a <hi>Hoter Fire,</hi> then ever yet we have mett with, and which we have all Reason to look for, the Lord knoweth how soon; that as we have lately been <hi>surprized into a Deliverance,</hi> even so, we may deservedly expect ere long to be <hi>Surprized unto Ruine,</hi> if we improve not this day of our merciful Visitation better than hitherto we have done: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we profess to be GODs People, therefore perhaps we expect Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from stroaks, and to pass unpunished; But the Spirit of GOD argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth quite otherways, <hi>Amos.</hi> 3.2. <hi>You only have I known of all the Families of the Earth; therefore, I will punish you.
